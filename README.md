# React Animation

This is a project example how you could add some animations on your react project. This project was created with **create-react-app** also we are using this dependency for the animation part **react-transition-group**.

This project it is an extra from the Udemy Course about React.js by Maximiliam Schwarzm√ºller. You can check the course right here [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/ "Udemy Course")

To install the dependencies you can do it with **npm install** or **yarn install** just remember to once installed keep using the same command (npm or yarn) to start the project.

The projects shows how can we use css code with react component to not only give style to also make any type of animation. We using **react-transition-group** to show the different way how could we work with react, but also the propuse about it is how you could work propertly with this. 

And of course **react-transition-group** it is not the only one dependency that you can use for this. There is another ones you could use and probably have the same results or feel more controfable with that.

### Keep Learning. Keep practice and have patience xD
